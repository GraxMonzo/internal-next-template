This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template project that uses Gadget's internal linting configs, TypeScript settings, and BaseUI setup.

## Using

Run

`yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/gadget-inc/internal-next-template`

to create a new Next.js app.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Linting

To correct any errors and autoformat everything, run:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

To check if all the existing code lints properly, run:

```bash
yarn lint
```
